;;; Commentary:

;; This program extract big words from text.
;; The words whose Zipf frequency less than `mybigword-upper-limit' are
;; big words.
;;
;; Zipf scale was proposed by Marc Brysbaert, who created the SUBTLEX lists.
;; Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it
;; appears per billion words.
;;
;; A word with Zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words,for example, and a
;; word with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words.
;;
;; Reasonable Zipf values are between 0 and 8, but the minimum Zipf value
;; appearing here is 1.0.
;;
;; We use 0 as the default Zipf value for words that do not appear in the given
;; word list,although it should mean one occurrence per billion words."
;;
;; Thanks to https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq for providing the data.
;;
;; Usage,
;;
;;   Run `mybigword-show-big-words-from-file'
;;   Run `mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer'
;;
;;
;; Customize `mybigword-excluded-words' or `mybigword-personal-excluded-words' to
;; exclude words.
;;
;; Customize `mybigword-default-format-function' to format the word for display.
;; If it's `mybigword-format-with-dictionary', the `dictionary-definition' is used to
;; find the definitions of all big words.
;;
;; Customize `mybigword-hide-word-function' to hide word for display
;;
